# Active Context
## Current Focus
Resolving XR simulation discrepancies:
1. Camera rig floating above floor
2. Missing mouse camera controls
3. Scene objects snapping back when moved

## Recent Changes
- Added XRSimMouseLook script for camera control
- Implemented TransformSync for position tracking

## Next Steps
- Investigate camera rig positioning system
- Verify mouse input mappings
- Check transform synchronization logic
