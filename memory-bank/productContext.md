# Product Context
## Purpose
Enable XR development and testing without physical hardware by providing accurate simulation of VR interactions. This allows for faster iteration during development cycles.

## User Experience Goals
- Seamless transition between VR and simulation modes
- Identical interaction patterns in both modes
- Realistic environment representation
- Immediate feedback on interaction changes
