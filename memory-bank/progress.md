# Progress
## Current Status
- XR simulation mode partially implemented
- Core VR functionality working with headset
- Simulation mode exhibits positioning and input issues

## Known Issues
1. **Camera Positioning**: XR camera rig spawns above floor level in simulation
2. **Input Handling**: Mouse look controls not functioning
3. **Object Persistence**: Edited object positions reset immediately

## Work Completed
- Basic XR environment setup
- VR interaction implementation
- Simulation mode scaffolding

## Pending Tasks
- Fix camera rig positioning
- Implement mouse look controls
- Ensure object position persistence
