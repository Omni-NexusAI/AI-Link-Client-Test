# Project Brief
## Overview
Unity project for XR simulation testing. Goal is to create a simulation environment that closely matches VR mode behavior for efficient testing without headset.

## Key Requirements
- XR camera rig must be properly positioned at floor level
- Mouse camera controls must function in simulation mode
- Scene objects should maintain edited positions without snapping
- Simulation should mirror VR behavior for core interactions
